# neural chrome dino

This repository contains a modified version of https://github.com/chrisdothtml/chrome-dino, where the human player is replaced by a feed forward neural network. The network was partially trained via [neuroevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution), however more training is needed to make it superhuan :).

```sh
$ cd neural-chrome-dino

$ npx serve .
```
